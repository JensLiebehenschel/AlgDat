Supplemental material for lecture Algorithms and Data Structures - not only at Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences

Interested in a some more information? - Sure, here we go, see my answers to questions you might have.

What is the main idea behind this approach?
- My goal was to have a tool to enable a better understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- There was one main criterion: It should be a static view that discloses the steps of algorithms "at a glance".
- Obviously, this is much easier for algorithms working with linear data structures than with graphs, for example.
  - For linear data structures we can use an additional dimension (e.g. the x axis) for visualization of the behavior over time.
- All notebooks are stand-alone, i.e. can be used without the others.

What is the history of this approach?
- Since I lectured algorithms and data structures for the first time in 2016 I was looking for a good visualization of algorithms.
- From time to time I looked at it but most of the time neglected working on it.
- During preparation of the lecture for summer 2021 the topic came back to my focus.

Why was this public repository created?
- It is easier to access it from outside the university network.
- I also want to make this work available to people outside Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences.

What are the references?
- Only for the standard algorithms and data structures sources were used.
- The material and the python code we provide to our students, initially created by my colleague Jörg Schäfer.
  - This is based among other literature on the book Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et. al.

Why Python?
- Well, why not? - Ok, I made the answer too easy for me.
- There are so many reasons, it is easy to learn, you can write compact code, and used in many domains.
- Python is appropriate for quickly writing powerful code.
- Further it is the language for data science and artificial intelligence, so it is worth learning it.

Sometimes the code is not pythonic, why?
- This is done due to didactical reasons (again an easy answer) ...
- ... but: The goal is to learn about basic algorithms and data structures, so we need to see all calculation steps.
- Python offers most of the functionality with a single method call, but one cannot see what is going on.
  - Examples: methods index() and sort() for lists instead of algorithms searching and sorting functions.

Why Jupyter notebooks?
- It is a good way to work with Python code.
- Simply use it on your computer without any software installation by launching the binder.

What can I do with the provided Jupyter notebooks?
- There are many possibilities, just play around with the algorithms and data structures.
- You can have a look at the notebooks, at the code, the statistics and the visualization.
- You can run them with the same or other data, our or even better with code changes.
  - Example: Modifications for getting other statistics or different visualizations.
- You can play around with the code and adapt it to your individual needs.

Why are there different notebooks for all algorithms and data structures?
- Quite simple, they have different objectives.
- You always find one with the basic functionality, here you can start using the algorithms.
- Then you might find other notebooks with more functionalily but less clarity of the basic algorithms due to necessary code instrumentation.
  - Examples: Output of runtime statistics or graphical visualization of the behavior.

Why are there different statistics for different algorithms?
- I tried to show different aspects that gain insight into the behavior of the algorithms.
- If you would like to see other statistics, please implement them on your own.

How to start?
- Several possibilities, you first need to know what you want to look at.
- First, select an algorithm or a data structure you want to understand.
- Then have a look at the available notebooks and understand what is implemented, the notebook name describes the content.
- Finally adapt the code to see what happens. Does it behave as expected?

Will there be more algorithms and data structures in the future?
- Maybe, we will see.

What to do if I find an error or want to make a suggestion for improvement?
- What, an error? No, unbelievable - Ok, it is software and there are errors ...
- ... and great, just contact me via email, perhaps you already have a fix for it.
- If you want to contribute, also send me an email.

Anything else?
- Yes, I hope it is useful for understandig the basic algorithms and data structures.
- Playing around with the code supports you in understanding the algorithms and data structures.
- The more you play around with the code, the deeper your understanding might get.
- Have fun using the notebooks and learning!
