## AlgDat
Supplemental material for lecture Algorithms and Data Structures - not only at Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences

This repository provides Jupyter notebooks with the implementation of basic algorithms and data structures.
You can play around with the code in many ways.
The intention is to deepen the undestanding by adapting and running the code. 

For more details please look into [the FAQs](FAQs.md).

## Important points when working with Jupiter Notebooks
* For execution of the complete code in a notebook click on "Kernel", then on "Restart & Run All"
* Before running parts of a notebook (e.g. after you changed something), you first need to execute the complete code
* At the end of your experiments click on "File", then on "Close and Halt"
* Note that you cannot save your work such that it is available when you launch the binder next time. 
* But there are different possibilities, for example:
  * Work locally on your computer or in a repository you own. You need appropriate software installed on your computer.
  * Save the files to browser cache and restore them later. There are two buttons in Jupyter notebook.
* Find the right way for you to work with this code and consider the respective documentation for it.

## Have fun using it!
