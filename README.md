## AlgDat
Supplemental material for lecture Algorithms and Data Structures - not only at Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences

This repository provides Jupyter notebooks with the implementation of basic algorithms and data structures.
You can play around with the code in many ways.
The intention is to deepen the undestanding by adapting and running the code. 

For more details please look into [the FAQs](FAQs.md).

## Important points when working with Jupiter Notebooks
* For execution of the complete code in a notebook click on "Kernel", then on "Restart & Run All"
* Before running parts of a notebook (e.g. after you changed something), you first need to execute the complete code
* At the end of your experiments click on "File", then on "Close and Halt"

## Have fun using it!
