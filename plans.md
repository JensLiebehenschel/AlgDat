## Current work
* BFS and DFS

## Ideas for future work
#### Linear data structures
* ?
#### Non-linear data structures - here it is necessary to find a good visualization (step-by-step at a glance)
* BFS and DFS
* Dijkstra
* Tree traversal algorithms (Pre-, In-, Postorder)
* Binary Search Trees
* Red-Black-Trees
